        <div>We used to have a light<br>Now it's too dark to shine</div>
        <div>Now we're just passing by<br>Two shipwrecks in the night</div>
        <div>Remember when we met?<br>Yeah, I know I was mean</div>
        <div>Stones shirt, black boots<br>and black jeans</div>
        <div>And you were such a mess<br>I thought it was sweet</div>
        <div>But that night still<br>haunts my dreams</div>

        <div>I won't keep chasing ghosts</div>
        <div>I need somebody I can hold</div>
        <div>Gave you my heart and soul</div>
        <div>Thought I was chasing love<br>I was only chasing a ghost</div>
        <div>Thought I was chasing love<br>I was only chasing a ghost</div>

        <div>Blue from the TV light,<br>Two bodies intertwined</div>
        <div>I guess we tempted fate<br>Always so far away</div>
        <div>Remember when we met?<br>Yeah, I know I was mean</div>
        <div>Stones shirt, black boots<br>and black jeans</div>
        <div>And you were such a mess<br>I thought it was sweet</div>
        <div>But that night still<br>haunts my dreams</div>

        <div>Gave you my heart and soul</div>
        <div>Thought I was chasing love<br>I was only chasing a ghost</div>
        <div>Thought I was chasing love<br>I was only chasing a ghost</div>

        <div>Remember when you left?<br>Yeah, I thought it was mean</div>
        <div>Stones shirt, black boots<br>and black jeans</div>
        <div>I let you fool me twice.<br>Well, shame on me</div>
        <div>That night still<br>haunts my dreams</div>

        <div>I won't keep chasing ghosts</div>
        <div>I need somebody I can hold</div>
        <div>Gave you my heart and soul</div>
